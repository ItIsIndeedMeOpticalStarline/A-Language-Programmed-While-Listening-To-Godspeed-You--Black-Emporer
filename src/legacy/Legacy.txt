This code is for a code translator to C++, written before the ALBWLTGY!BE interpreter was made. It has some bugs and will not
be supported by the language creator.

        --::COMMANDS::--
- print: pops then prints the top value of the stack
- comp: pops then compares the top two values of the stack if the top value is not an array. Pushes a zero if they are equal and a one if they are not
- swap: swaps the top two values on the stack
- loop: represents a while value != 0
- end: ends the loop or subroutine
- dup: duplicates the top value on the stack
- sum: pops then adds the top two values of the stack
- difference: pops then subtracts the top two values of the stack
- product: pops then multiplies the top two values of the stack
- quotient: pops then divides the top two values of the stack
- remainder: pops the mods the top two values of the stack
- skip: pops a number and if that number is not zero skips x number of instructions
- read: reads user input and pushes it onto the stack as a charms or charms array
- give up: ends the program
