# A-Language-Programmed-While-Listening-To-Godspeed-You--Black-Emporer
An esoteric programming language written in Rust.

  First esolang and first Rust project. Not very neat. The code is translated to C++, instead of interpreted or compiled. The C++ code must be then manually be
compiled by the programmer. No need for a CMake, just compile from the command line. Open to contributions, but I may not accept your contributions if they don't
fit into the style I would like for ALPWLTGY!BE to have. I plan to make an interpreter instead of a translator, eventually. I cannot fix some bugs and implement
some features that I want using the translation method. Still a WIP. - Eve (3/17/22)
